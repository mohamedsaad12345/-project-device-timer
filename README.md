Project Summary: Herbal Store Device

I designed and built a complete herbal store device from scratch, using the ATmega328P microcontroller. The project incorporates the following key components:

1. LCD Display: Used to display information and settings.


2. Buttons: Four buttons (Mode, Select, Up, and Down) for navigation and control.


3. RTC Module: Keeps track of the current time and ensures accurate scheduling.


4. Motor and Fan: Controlled via the buttons to automate operations.



Functionality:

The device allows the user to configure and schedule the motor and fan operations throughout the day.

The code is programmed with precise time management, enabling start and stop times as well as intervals of operation.

Users can easily adjust settings using the buttons and monitor the status on the LCD screen.

This project combines automation and precise scheduling to enhance the efficiency of a herbal store.
